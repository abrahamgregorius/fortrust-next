                            An internship is no longer just for university students. Gaining
                            professional experience early on is a powerful way to explore career
                            interests, build valuable skills, and create a standout university
                            application. Our 1-month program is specifically designed to place
                            ambitious high school students in leading multinational companies,
                            providing a structured and impactful first taste of the corporate
                            world.
